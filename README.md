# Music App

#### Independently completed assignment for an online course.
Demonstrates use of basic Android and Java tools including SharedPreferences, classes and class adapters, click listeners, listviews, and intents.
Uses a dependency, GSON, which was not introduced in the class and which I researched and added to the project.
